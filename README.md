# Portfolio-Site
Building a portfolio site using HTML(5), Sass, Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript.

To Do:
- Skills section:
  1. add depth of knowledge to each skill.
  2. add a transition to the y transform of the skills div.
  3. add label to the skills JSON to support headings with embedded spaces.
- Featured Work section:
  1. add the Blizzard Support Portal.
  2. how about Salesforce and Hivemind?
  3. a slider would be cooler than the modals for presenting additional information. Also need a visual cue that there is additional information available.
  4. add shadows to the project icons.
