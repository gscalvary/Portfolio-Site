# Portfolio-Site
Building a portfolio site using HTML(5), CSS(3), Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript.
All data is stored in valid JSON formats.

To Do
a) Add a vertical navbar or scrollspy because it's cool (and it helps with navigation).
b) Skills section:
  i)   add depth of knowledge to each skill.
  ii)  add a transition to the y transform of the skills div.
  iii) add label to the skills JSON to support headings with embedded spaces.
c) Featured Work section:
  i)   add the Blizzard Support Portal.
  ii)  how about Salesforce and Hivemind?
  iii) a slider would be cooler than the modals for presenting additional information.
       Also need a visual cue that there is additional information available.
  iv)  add shadows to the project icons.
